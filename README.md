# Lame-Emden Astrophysics
In astrophysics, the Lane-Emden equation, named after Jonathan Homer Lane and Robert Emden, describes the structure of a star 
with a polytropic equation of state P = Kρ(n+1)/n. This equation is a dimensionless form of Poisson’s equation for the gravitational
potential of a Newtonian self-gravitating, spherically symmetric, polytropic ﬂuid and therefore, it can be applied to diﬀerent types 
of stars by varying n: the polytropic index.

In Section 2.1, we will show the case when n = 1, and the relevant physical solution applicaple to the system. 
Section 2.2 will consider some general n from where the n = 1 case can be retrieved. Lastly, in Section 2.3, we will demonstrate diﬀerent 
polytropic indices that do not have an analytic solution to them, but instead we direct ourselves the numerical approach. Graphs are 
presented at the end of the section. In section 3 we present conclusions from the aftermath. Finally, two codes are presented in the 
appendix, we show the numerical output of one of them and give references.

# Determining the Potential of a Cylindrical System Using the Modiﬁed Bessel Functions

For the system of a point charge q located at the point (ρ, φ, z) inside a grounded cylindrical box bounded by 
surfaces z=0, z=L, ρ = a, we have derived the Green’s function and thereby the potential inside the box using the 
modiﬁed Bessel functions of the ﬁrst and second kinds: In(x) and Kn(x), respectively. Using this result, we ﬁnd the
potential inside a cylindrical box held at zero potential at all surfaces except for a disc in the upper end of radius b, 
where b < a, held at potential V. In the case that ρ = 0, z=L/2, and b=L/4=a/2, we ﬁnd the ratio Φ/V to 10 signiﬁcant ﬁgures
to be Φ/V = 0.0715293729
